# MY ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS

This repository contains all the playbooks etc that I have created as I learn more and more about ansible and python.

As of now (August 25, 2022) I have two playbooks currently in use on my home server that runs apt Updates on my servers and does a backup of my home server and copies the archives to my DO Space.

Stay tuned as I do more with ansible.

As of today (Sept. 5, 2022), I have 3 backups, a backup cleaner, and an apt update/upgrade playbook in play. Learning more and more. Realised I was leaking some information I should not have been leaking and fixed that. And now I am beginning to look at roles to make my playbooks more re-usable.

I <3 ansible and python!
