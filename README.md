# MY ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS

This repository contains all the playbooks etc that I have created as I learn more and more about ansible and python.

As of now (August 25, 2022) I have two playbooks currently in use on my home server that runs apt Updates on my servers and does a backup of my home server and copies the archives to my DO Space.

Stay tuned as I do more with ansible.
